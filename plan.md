# Planning my 100 days of code

## Web Development:

### Front-End Development:

1. HTML
1. CSS
1. JS

Maybe later we focus on ReactJS once I get my hands dirty with css.

### Back-End Development:

1. NodeJS
2. ExpressJS
3. MongoDB

and there is a lot more to go when developping the back-end, things such as authentication, data base models, middlewares, etc etc..
